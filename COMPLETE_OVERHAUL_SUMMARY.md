## Project Summary

**Objective**: Remove all visual styling from the inventory system and implement pure Animal Crossing-style drag-and-drop behavior.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date**: October 26, 2025

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Removed All Visual Effects
- ❌ Golden glow effects
- ❌ Shadow frames  
- ❌ Blur effects on screen
- ❌ All UIStroke highlights (including yellow outline)
- ❌ All animations and tweens (15+ TweenService calls)
- ❌ Hover effects on items
- ❌ Slot dimming during drag
- ❌ Ghost item expansion
- ❌ Background transparency animations
- ❌ Text transparency transitions

### 2. Simplified All Functions
- ✅ `configureSlotFrame()` - Now just handles clicks
- ✅ `beginDrag()` - Creates simple ghost, tracks cursor
- ✅ `finishDrag()` - Instantly places item, no animations
- ✅ `updateSlotAppearance()` - Only sets icon and count
- ✅ `setInventoryVisible()` - Just toggles visibility
- ✅ Removed `setupInventoryDragLayer()` - Not needed

### 3. Implemented Animal Crossing Behavior
- ✅ Click item → picks up and follows cursor
- ✅ Move cursor around → item follows instantly
- ✅ Click again → item drops at cursor location
- ✅ All happening with ZERO animations
- ✅ Works exactly like Animal Crossing

## Key Changes

### Click Behavior
```lua
-- BEFORE: Multiple buttons for hover, drag, highlight
HoverButton → Size animation
DragButton → Start drag only
HighlightStroke → Visual only

-- AFTER: Single click button for everything
ClickButton → Click = pick up or drop
```

### Ghost Item
```lua
-- BEFORE: Complex ghost with effects
ghost.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255)
ghost.BackgroundTransparency = 0.15  -- Was visible
-- Shadow frame added
-- UIStroke glow added
-- Size animation tweened

-- AFTER: Simple transparent clone
ghost.BackgroundTransparency = 1  -- Invisible background
-- Just a container for item icon
```

### Animation System
```lua
-- BEFORE: Everywhere
TweenService:Create(slot, TweenInfo.new(0.15, ...), {...}):Play()
TweenService:Create(ghost, TweenInfo.new(0.1, ...), {...}):Play()
TweenService:Create(blur, TweenInfo.new(0.25, ...), {...}):Play()

-- AFTER: None
-- Position updates are direct (no tweens)
-- No appearance changes
-- No blur effects
```

### Drag Tracking
```lua
-- BEFORE: 130+ line function
- Complex shadow animation
- Multiple option flags
- Extensive appearance changes

-- AFTER: 50 line function
- Simple ghost creation
- RenderStepped position update
- Clean state tracking
```

## Quick Reference

### File Structure
```
ItemSlotTemplate (Your template in Studio)
├── ItemIcon (ImageLabel - shows item)
├── ItemCount (TextLabel - shows "5x", etc.)
└── ClickButton (TextButton - created by script)
```

### How Drag Works
```
1. User clicks ClickButton
2. Script calls beginDrag()
3. Creates ghost (transparent copy)
4. RenderStepped updates ghost position
5. User clicks again
6. Script calls finishDrag()
7. Determines drop location
8. Updates inventory
9. Ghost destroyed
```

### Where Items Come From/Go
```
Start: Inventory slot
↓
During drag: Ghost follows cursor
↓
On drop in slot: Swap with target item
↓
On drop outside: Goes to ground (server)
```
