# ✅ COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY

## 🔧 ALL ISSUES FIXED!

### 1. ✅ Removed 3D Model Loading
- **Problem**: TomNookSpawner was trying to load 3D assets (assetId:77893066933188)
- **Fix**: Forced fallback model only - simple colored blocks
- **Result**: Tom Nook now spawns as a simple placeholder!

### 2. ✅ Fixed IslandManagementGUI Error
- **Problem**: "Fill is not a valid member of Enum.HorizontalAlignment"
- **Fix**: Changed to `Enum.HorizontalAlignment.Center`
- **Result**: Island Management GUI now loads without errors!

### 3. ✅ Added Proper Spawn Location
- **Problem**: Players spawning at random campsite location
- **Fix**: Created invisible spawn pad at hub center (0, 3, 0)
- **Result**: Players spawn at hub center!

## 🏝️ HOW TO RESET YOUR ISLAND DATA

Your player already has an island saved, so Tom Nook shows the "Island Management GUI" instead of the onboarding.

### TO START FRESH:

**Option 1: Studio Test Mode**
1. In Studio, go to **Test** tab
2. Click **Cleanup** button
3. This clears all saved data
4. Press F5 again

**Option 2: Manual Reset**
1. Stop the game
2. In Studio, go to **View** → **Game Explorer**  
3. Find **ServerStorage** → **PlayerData**
4. Delete any folders you see there
5. Press F5 again

**Option 3: Code Reset (Quick)**
Add this to the TOP of `src/server/init.server.luau` temporarily:
```lua
-- TEMPORARY: Reset island data for testing
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
    local playerDataStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerIslands")
    playerDataStore:RemoveAsync("Player_" .. player.UserId)
    print("[Server] Reset island data for", player.Name)
end)
```
