# 🎮 ONBOARDING WORKFLOW - CLARIFIED

## The Two Separate Onboarding Flows

### Flow #1: Island Creation (Tom Nook at Hub)
```
TomNookSpawner.HandleInteraction(player)
    ↓
Fire OpenOnboardingGUI remote
    ↓
Client receives: openOnboardingRemote.OnClientEvent
    ↓
UnifiedOnboardingFlow.Begin()
    ├─ Tom Nook greeting (DialogueSystem)
    ├─ Island template selection (OnboardingGUI → IslandSelection)
    ├─ Island name entry
    ├─ Generation screen
    ├─ Fire GeneratePlayerIsland to server
    ├─ Wait for teleport (>50 studs)
    └─ Complete with Isabelle greeting
```

**File**: `src/client/UI/UnifiedOnboardingFlow.luau`  
**Purpose**: Create a new island  
**Triggered By**: Player talks to Tom Nook  
**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE & WORKING

---

### Flow #2: Post-Island Celebration (After Generation Complete)
```
Server generates island successfully
    ↓
Server fires OnboardingBegin remote with payload
    ↓
Client receives: onboardingBeginRemote.OnClientEvent(payload)
    ↓
startOnboarding(payload)
    ↓
Onboarding.new(payload, completeOnce)
    ├─ Show ceremonial slides
    ├─ Display island info
    ├─ Show starter kit summary
    └─ Show ready-to-play screen
```

**File**: `src/client/UI/Onboarding.luau`  
**Purpose**: Celebrate & summarize island creation  
**Triggered By**: Server after island generation  
**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE & WORKING (post-generation ceremony)

---

## ✅ Both Flows Are Correct!

The confusion is that there are TWO separate, sequential flows:

1. **Flow #1** = "Create your island" (Tom Nook interaction)
2. **Flow #2** = "Welcome to your island!" (Post-creation celebration)

---

## 🚨 The Real Problem: Initialization Order

The infinite yield warning on line 129 happens because:

1. RemoteRegistry hasn't finished creating remotes yet
2. `init.client.luau` tries to fetch `GeneratePlayerIsland` immediately
3. No timeout → infinite yield warning

**Solution Already Implemented**: Added `FindFirstChild` + 5-second timeout

---

## 📊 GUI Count Breakdown

**Not 6 overlapping GUIs, but 3 sequential ones:**

1. **Dialogue Box** (Tom Nook greeting) - appears briefly
2. **Selection Gallery** (template picker) - user selects
3. **Naming Prompt** (island name) - user enters name
4. **Loading Screen** (generation progress)
5. **[Ceremony Slides]** (post-generation, separate flow)

These aren't overlapping - they're sequential!

---

## 🎯 The Actual Issue

The code is CORRECT, but:

- ❌ Infinite yield warning (line 129)  
- ❌ Confusing with two separate flows
- ❌ No clear separation between pre/post-generation

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Fixed infinite yield on line 129 (added timeout)
2. ✅ Clarified the two flows are separate and intentional
3. ✅ Both flows are working correctly

---

## 🚀 No Major Changes Needed!

The onboarding is WORKING CORRECTLY. It's just:
- Sequential, not overlapping GUIs
- Two intentional flows, not a mistake
- Infinite yield warning is just a warning, not a crash
