# üèùÔ∏è Player Initiation System - Complete!

## Overview

A comprehensive character-driven onboarding system where **Tom Nook, Isabelle, Orville, Blathers, Timmy & Tommy**, and other special characters guide players through island creation, home setup, and services introduction.

## What Was Created

### 1. **PlayerInitiationOrchestrator** (`src/server/Systems/`)
Coordinates the entire player journey through 11 stages, with each special character playing their role at the right time.

### 2. **NPCServiceManager** (`src/server/Services/`)
Manages all services provided by special characters, making it easy to call character-specific functions like:
- Tom Nook: Island creation, home upgrades, infrastructure
- Isabelle: Island evaluation, flag/tune changes, resident management
- Orville: Mystery island tours, friend visits, Dodo codes
- Blathers: Donations, fossil assessment
- K.K. Slider: Song requests, performances

Both systems are globally accessible for easy integration:

```lua
-- Access player initiation system
local initiation = _G.PlayerInitiation

-- Check if player completed initiation
if initiation:HasCompletedInitiation(player.UserId) then
    print("Player has completed onboarding!")
end

-- Get current stage
local stage = initiation:GetPlayerStage(player.UserId)

initiation:SetPlayerStage(player.UserId, "museum_intro")

local dialogue = initiation:GetStageDialogue(player.UserId)
```

tomNookServices.CreateIsland(player)

-- Direct access
local isabelleServices = npcServices:IsabelleServices()
local rating = isabelleServices.EvaluateIsland(player)
```

## Character Data Integration

All dialogue uses real Nookipedia character data:

```lua
-- Example from PlayerInitiationOrchestrator
local isabelle = self._characterDB:GetCharacterInfo("Isabelle")

dialogueRemote:FireClient(player, {
    villagerName = isabelle.name,        -- "Isabelle"
    text = isabelle.quote,                -- "Life is what you make it!"
    personality = isabelle.personality,   -- "Normal"
    species = isabelle.species,           -- "Shih Tzu"
    role = isabelle.role,                 -- "Island Representative"
})
```

Each character's personality, quotes, and role influence their dialogue and behavior!

## Integration Points

### 1. **Tom Nook Island Creation**
When player talks to Tom Nook at hub:
```lua
-- In TomNookRealSpawner or similar
if playerInitiation then
    playerInitiation:StartIslandCreation(player)
end
```

### 2. **Island Creation Complete**
After island is generated:
```lua
-- In PlayerIslandService
if playerInitiation then
    playerInitiation:OnIslandCreated(player, islandData)
end
```

### 3. **Tutorial Quest Complete**
After fishing quest is done:
```lua
-- In FishingQuest
if playerInitiation then
    playerInitiation:OnTutorialComplete(player)
end
```

### 4. **Manual Service Calls**
Anytime you need a character service:
```lua
-- Open Tom Nook's home upgrade menu
local tomNookServices = _G.NPCServices:TomNookServices()
local success, cost = tomNookServices.UpgradeHome(player, 2)

if success then
    print("Upgrade costs:", cost.bells, "bells")
    print("Description:", cost.description)
end
```
